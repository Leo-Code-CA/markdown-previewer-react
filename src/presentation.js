Rendering markdown!\n### This tool was built with an amazing framework called [React](https://react.dev/learn).\n Let me show you a few examples of what you can do. Don't worry, it's pretty straightforward!\n\nYou can render some inline code \`<div></div>\` or even a code block if you feel like it:\n\n\`\`\`\n\nconst myObject = {\n\nframework: 'react',\n\ntool: 'markdown previewer'\n\n}\n\n\`\`\`\n\nIf you're an organized kind of person, you're going to like those different types of lists!\n\nUnordered list:\n\n- This is my first unordered item!\n\n- This is my second unordered item!\n\n- This is my third unordered item!\n\nOrdered list:\n\n1. This is my first ordered item!\n\n2. This is my second ordered item!\n\n3. This is my third ordered item!\n\nAnd even… tasks list:\n\n- [x] The first task is completed!\n\n- [x] The second task is completed!\n\n- [ ] The third task is not completed yet!\n\nIf you are a quote addict, you will probably appreciate what's next… blockquotes!\n\n> 'You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.' -Zig Ziglar\n\nI particularly love that one so I'll also add an image of it!\n\n![quote](quote.jpg)\n\nNow… it's your turn, **have fun!**`;
